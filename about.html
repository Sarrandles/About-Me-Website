      <h1>The Basics</h1>
      <p>
        Alright, well, writing about yourself is difficult and awkward, so buckle up!
        My name is Sarah Randles and I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan <em>*woot woot*</em>!
          I enjoy burritos, dismantling the patriarchy, playing video games, and fighting live bears for money.
          I've worked at two libraries, a bookstore, and schools over the years
          and I'm the happiest when I have a book in my hand. Do you like lists? I like lists.
